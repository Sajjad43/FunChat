This is a chatting android mobile application developed with JAVA. The main goal is to replicate the Whatsapp. 
In this chatting application, an user can send text, pictures, videos and create group chat. 

Java socket programming is used for client-server connection. Java database programming is used for storing data. 
It was a very lengthy project but worth doing it in collaboration with my faculty Tarif Riyad Rahman at North South University, Bangladesh.
